This is a website for a Pizza restaurant that allows users to order pizzas from the restaurant REYK among ordering,
drinks and choose from the offers and discounts the restaurant has.

These are the programming rules we followed:
General rules:
- 4 spaces for tab width, lines indented with tab.
- 80 characters max per line.
- 2 new line characters after each function.
- Descriptive names for all variables and functions
- Each function only has one purpose.
- Reuse code when possible.
- All imports at the start of a document, and constants thereafter.
Python rules:
- Snake case for attributes and functions, but camel case for classes.
- Docstrings for all functions and comments when needed to further clarify code.
JavaScript rules:
- Use const and let instead of var.
- Semicolon at the end of each line.
HTML rules:
- Alt attributes for all images and graphics.
- All code should pass a validation check.
CSS rules:
- Same order for similar formatting.
- Group styles by location, 2 new line characters after location and one between styles.

Here are some extra requirements we did that was not part of the assignment requirements:
- A user does not need to input profile information when checking out, user can have a profile that
auto-fills in profile when checking out from cart.
- A user can navigate to an about us page.
- An overview of the order is visible on all steps of the checkout process
- A user can choose a discount on a specified day of the week or month.
- A link to an instagram page for the resturant.
- A link to the resturants location on Google Maps.

To be able to do the next steps your terminal source needs to be in the pizza_lair folder:

To start the application you need to run "pip -r requirements.txt" in the terminal to 
install all required applications for the virtual environment.

Lastly you need to run "python manage.py runserver --insecure" in the terminal to start the server.
Now you will need to click the link in the terminal to the website.

We recommend running the website on either Chrome or Firefox, the site was tested on those browsers.

ENJOY! :)
